I have used the django framework to build the API system

i have made two models one for dashcam info and another to upload the video as there is many-one relationship between dashcam info and videos for each dashcam we can interlink both using foreign key integrity constraints

In views.py i have made four POST api functions for new user, video upload, location update and event responses.
I have used inbuilt django sqlite database for storing the data. 

I didn't understand the complete machanism behind the event response so couldn't be able to build it perfectly.

Also there was alot of time constraints still i have tried to make it as good as possible.
